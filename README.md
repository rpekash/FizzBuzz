# FizzBuzz

# What is this project?

This project showcases a simple program known as "FizzBuzz" that prints numbers from 1 to 100 with a twist:

For numbers divisible by 3, it prints Fizz.
For those divisible by 5, Buzz.
For numbers divisible by both 3 and 5, FizzBuzz.
Otherwise, it just prints the number itself.

# How It Works

Loop Through Numbers: The program iterates through numbers 1 to 100.
Check Conditions: For each number, it checks divisibility by 3 and 5 to decide whether to print the number, Fizz, Buzz, or FizzBuzz.
